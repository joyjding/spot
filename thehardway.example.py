## Redoing Learn Python the Hard Way in order to build up my language


## EX 1: 
print "Hello World"
print "I'd much rather you 'not'"

## Ex 2: 
print "I could have code like this." # comment

## Ex 3:
print "I will now count my chickens:"
print "Hens", 25 + 30 / 6
print "What is 3+2?", 3+2
print "Is it greater?". 5 > -2

## Ex 4
cars = 100
space_in_acar = 4.0
drivers = 30
passengers = 90
cars_not_driven = cars - drivers
cars_driven = drivers
carpool_capacity = cars_driven * space_in_a_car
average_passengers_per_car = passengers / cars_driven

print "There are", cars, "cars available."
print "There are only", drivers, "drivers available."
print "There will be", cars_not_driven, "empty cars today."
print "We can transport", carpool_capacity, "people today."
print "We have", passengers, "to carpool today."
print "We need to put about", average_passengers_per_car, "in each car."

## Ex 5

my_name = "Joy"
