Hello there! So nice to meet you. 

Spot is an English syntax programming language that seeks to expose and teach a beginner programmer the logic foundations of programming without the overhead of learning what different symbols mean. Spot's machinery (parser/interpreter/compiler) is built on Python. Most of Spot compiles to x86 assembly.

So without further ado, let's get started!

Setup (The boring, but necessary part)

Go ahead and clone this repository to your computer. That gives you the requisite PLY library to run the lexer, a couple of sample Spot files to play with and spot.py, which is the engine that drives Spot. Then, you can start writing .spot files on your own!
