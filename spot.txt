# Demo Program

		Screensay: "She said, 'Hello World!'" (Hello!)
	(What a nifty language!)
		Screensay: "I have [4/2] learn it!"
		This is new variable cars. Set cars' value to 100.
		Change car's value to "dog".  






## (Ex1) Printing --> screensay

# Does this get mixed up with the meaning of quotation marks?

# He said, 
Show "Hello World"
Show "I'd much rather you 'not' "

OR

Say "Hello World"
Show me Hello World

OR 

screensay "He said, 'Hello World'"

## (Ex2) Comments --> (comment)

Thoughts: I don't want this to be too lengthy. But I could use Aside: 

1) Aside: comment. 
2) ( comment )
3) | comment |
4) <comment>
5) ?What is this line doing?
6) -Here's a comment-

## (ex3) Math --> [ ]

	+ -> +
	- -> -
	= -> = 
	> -> >
	< -> <
	* -> *
	"[25 +6/4]"

Thoughts:
The real problem comes with screensay and then doing math
I picked the # sign because it stands for math. 

Screensay: "I will now count my chickens:"
1) Screensay: "Hens, #25 + 30/6#"
2) Screensay: "Hens, (25 + 30/6)"
3) Screensay: "Hens, [25 + 30/6]"
4) Screensay: "Hens, ~25 + 30/6~" 
5) Screensay: "Hens, <25 + 30/6>"
6) Screensay: "Hens"; 25 + 30/6 # very similar to Python 

I like much better the way that the parentheses look. 
So I could potentially change comments to ^Hey here's a comment^. I'm okay with using square brackets for now. 

## (ex4) Variables 

Variable declaration-->
	This is cars, a new variable. Set cars' value to 100. 
Changing a variable's value-->
	Change cars' value to 200. 


# Thoughts: While I like pronouns, and think that would be an interesting challenge, I think people have a lot of trouble with pronouns. Actually, I'd really like to support both. 

Given time, I will support more options. Right now, I'll choose 8)ish.

1) This is cars. The value of cars is 100. 
1b) This is cars. Car's value is 100. 
2) This is cars. Its value is 100. # This is cool mostly because I want to handle pronouns
3) This is cars, a variable. Its value is 100. 
4) This is cars, a variable; its value is 100. 
5) Cars, a variable, has the value 100. 
6) New variable cars has the value 100.
7) This is space_in_a_car: its value is 4.0. 
8) This is new variable cars. Set cars' value to 100.
9) This is cars, a new variable. Set cars' value to 100. 
 
# Zed shaw code:
This is new variable cars. Set cars' value to 100.

## (ex5) Putting variables in strings

	This is my_name, a new variable. Set my_name's value
to "Joy"
	This is my_age, a new variable. Set my_age's value to
1000.
	This is my_height, a new variable. Set my_height's
value to 2000.

	Screensay: "Let's talk about [text]." [text]
	Screensay: "She's [integer] inches tall." [integer]
	








# Things I will need to handle:
Capitalization
















This is L.
L is a list.
